(FAQ) RTGS/ NEFT







							
							1. What is Inter Bank Transfer?
							




Inter Bank Transfer is a special service that allows you to transfer funds electronically to accounts in other banks in India through:


NEFT:
 NEFT: The acronym NEFT stands for National Electronic Funds Transfer. Funds are transferred to the credit account with the other participating Bank using RBI's NEFT service. RBI acts as the service provider and transfers the credit to the other bank's account. This system of fund transfer operates on a Deferred Net Settlement basis. Presently, NEFT operates on a 24x7x365 basis with half hourly settlement.






RTGS:
 The acronym RTGS stands for Real Time Gross Settlement. This is a system where the processing of funds transfer instructions takes place at the time they are received (real time). Also, the settlement of funds transfer instructions occurs individually on an instruction-by-instruction basis (gross settlement). The RTGS system is the one of the fastest interbank money transfer facility available through secure banking channels in India. RTGS is available on all days on 24x7x365 basis.
