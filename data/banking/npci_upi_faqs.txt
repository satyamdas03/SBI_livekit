What is UPI?





                                                Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is an instant payment system developed
                                                by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an RBI regulated
                                                entity. UPI is built over the IMPS infrastructure
                                                and allows you to instantly transfer money between any two parties' bank
                                                accounts.
                                            










What is an UPI-PIN?





                                                UPI-PIN (UPI Personal Identification Number) is a 4-6 digit pass code
                                                you create/set during first time registration with this App. You have to
                                                enter this UPI-PIN to authorize all bank
                                                transactions. If you have already set up an UPI-PIN with other UPI Apps
                                                you can use the same on BHIM. (Note: Banks issued MPIN is different from
                                                the UPI UPI-PIN, please generate a new UPI-PIN
                                                in the BHIM app) Note: Please do not share your UPI-PIN with anyone.
                                                BHIM does not store or read your UPI-PIN details and your bank's
                                                customer support will never ask for it.
                                            










What happens if I enter wrong
                                            UPI-PIN during a transaction?





                                                In case you enter the wrong UPI PIN , the transaction will fail. In case

What happens if my mobile
                                            phone is lost?

                                                no transaction can be initiated from the same mobile number which is a
                                                part of device tracking and at the same time UPI
                                                pin would be required for any transaction which is not to be shared with

                                                PSPs.

                                            channels for transferring funds using UPI?

                                                transferred back to the payer account immediately. In case if it does
                                                not reverse the amount immediately, you can contact
                                                your bank for the same.

                                            complaint with reference to the UPI transaction?




You can also raise your grievance or check status of UPI transaction
                                                through the UPI App of the participating banks.










What is the limit of fund
                                            transfer using UPI?

                                                transaction.
                                            










If I change my UPI app will I
                                            be required to register again or I can carry the same virtual address?

                                                pin using his debit card details (the last six digits of their debit
                                                card & expiry date).










Will I be able to use UPI
                                            after I change my sim or mobile?




In case of change in sim/mobile/application of the PSP, customer would
                                                require to re-register themselves for UPI.

                                                requester.

                                            another person, will there be any security breach?

                                                through the mobile at the time of any transaction making it safe and
                                                secured.










What if I change my mobile
                                            carrier?

                                            bank A/C information?





                                                This is a feature of the UPI payment platform (built by NPCI - an RBI
                                                regulated entity). The UPI platform retrieves the accounts details
                                                linked with your mobile number in a masked manner i.e.
                                                UPI app can't see all the details. This exchange is done over secure

                                                transactions which will not be known to any third person and hence they
                                                will not be able to use the UPI app. In addition,

                                                your phone.

                                            but my bank account has been debited.
