3. How does the NEFT system operate?


Ans:
 Following is the step-wise flow of NEFT transaction.


Step-1:
 An individual / firm /  corporate willing to transfer funds through NEFT can use the internet / mobile  banking facility offered by his / her bank for initiating online funds transfer  request. The remitter has to provide details of beneficiary such as, name of  the beneficiary, name of the bank branch where the beneficiary has an account,  IFSC of the beneficiary bank branch, account type and account number, etc. for  addition of the beneficiary to his / her internet / mobile banking module. Upon  successful beneficiary addition, the remitter can initiate online NEFT funds  transfer by authorising debit to his / her account. Alternatively, the remitter  can also visit his / her bank branch for initiating NEFT funds transfer through  branch / off-line mode. The customer has to fill-in the beneficiary details in  NEFT application form available at the bank branch and authorise the branch to debit  to his / her account to the extent of the amount requested in NEFT application  form.


Step-2:
 The originating bank  prepares a message and sends the message to its pooling centre, also called the  NEFT Service Centre.


Step-3:
 The pooling centre  forwards the message to the NEFT Processing Centre, operated by the RBI, to be  included for the next available batch.


Step-4:
 The Processing Centre  sorts the funds transfer transactions beneficiary bank-wise and prepares  accounting entries to receive funds from the originating banks (debit) and give  the funds to the beneficiary banks (credit). Thereafter, bank-wise remittance  messages are forwarded to the beneficiary banks through their pooling centre  (NEFT Service Centre).


Step-5:
 The beneficiary banks  receive the inward remittance messages from the Processing Centre and pass on the  credit to the beneficiary customers’ accounts.


4. What is Indian Financial System Code?


Ans:
 Indian Financial System Code (IFSC) is an  alpha-numeric code that uniquely identifies a bank-branch participating in the  NEFT system. It is a 11-digit code with the first 4 alpha characters  representing the bank, and the last 6 characters representing the branch. The 5th  character is 0 (zero). IFSC is used by the NEFT system to identify the  originating / destination banks / branches and also to route the messages  appropriately to the concerned banks / branches.


5. How can I find the IFSC of a bank-branch?


Ans:
 Bank-wise list of IFSCs is available with all the  bank-branches participating in NEFT scheme. List of bank-wise branches  participating in NEFT and their IFSCs is also available on the website of RBI  at 
https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=2009
. All member banks have  also been advised to print the IFSC of the branch on cheques issued to their  customers.


6. Who can avail NEFT system for fund transfer / receipt?


Ans:
 Individuals,  firms and corporates maintaining accounts with any member bank, participating  in the NEFT system, can electronically transfer funds to any individual, firm  or corporate having an account with any other bank in the country participating  in the NEFT system.


The list of bank-wise branches participating in NEFT is available on the  website of RBI at

8. Can the NEFT system be used for remitting funds even by those who do not  have a bank account?


Ans:
 Yes, a  person who does not have a bank account can remit funds through NEFT to a beneficiary  having a bank account, with another NEFT member bank. It can be done by depositing  cash at the nearest NEFT enabled branch of any bank, by furnishing additional  details such as complete address, telephone number, etc. Such cash remittances  will, however, be restricted to a maximum of ₹50,000 per transaction.


9. Can I send funds to my relative / friend residing abroad through NEFT  system?


Ans:
 The  outbound remittances through NEFT system are permitted only to Nepal under Indo-Nepal  Remittance Facility (INRF) Scheme. Under this Scheme, the remitter can transfer  funds from any of the NEFT-enabled bank branches in India to Nepal,  irrespective of whether the beneficiary in Nepal maintains an account with a  bank branch in Nepal or not. The beneficiary would receive funds in Nepalese  Rupees. The details of the INRF  Scheme are available on the website of RBI at
